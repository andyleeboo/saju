<h1>About Saju Insights</h1>

<p>
	Saju, also known as the Four Pillars of Destiny, is a traditional Korean form of astrology that
	uses your birth date and time to reveal insights about your personality, career, relationships,
	and health. By analyzing the interaction of the Five Elements—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and
	Water—in your life, saju provides a deeper understanding of your destiny and helps you make
	informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
	Originating from ancient Chinese metaphysics, saju has been adapted and refined in Korean culture.
	It is widely used for personal guidance, understanding life events, and making important life
	decisions. Whether you are seeking to understand yourself better or looking for direction in
	various aspects of your life, saju offers valuable insights.
</p>

<p>
	Our mission at Saju Insights is to bring this ancient wisdom to a global audience, helping people
	from all backgrounds uncover their true potential and achieve greater harmony in their lives.
